### A Note on the Future
At this point (2021), I'd strongly suggest looking into using SFSymbols for much of what I've used SVGgh for in the past. Still SVGs are a bit less complicated to make than a fully weighted SFSymbol. 

### Introduction
In my own apps, I've often wished to avoid using bitmapped images for my interface elements. Often, I'll need to add PNG files for Retina, and non-retina, iPhone and iPad, and find myself confined to what I can do with an interface in terms of stretching elements. And all this artwork made my app bulky. So, I decided to implement an SVG renderer which could use standard **Scalable Vector Graphics** documents to draw button icons, background art or whatever my art needs were. I have Apps in the App Store like [SVG Paths](http://AppStore.com/SVGPaths) whose only PNG files are the required icons. 

### Features
Handles shapes quite well such as paths, ellipses, circles, rectangles, polygons, polylines, and arcs with all the standard style attributes. Implements basic text and font handling, including rough text along a path. Implements both linear and radial gradients, including applying gradients to strokes and text. Implements scale invariant line widths. Provides a static UIView subclass, a UIControl button, and a segmented control. All are configurable from either nib or storyboards. Supports embedded bitmap images in standard formats. 

Can export to PDF, create UIImages, and print via the UIPrintInteractionController mechanism.

Can be integrated into SwiftUI Views. See the card example in the Debugging App.

In the Xcode debugger, you can use the QuickLook button (the eye icon) to see the contents of an SVGRenderer. 

### Limitations
The entire [SVG specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/) is not implemented. At present, it only implements the portions of the specification I needed or thought I might need. In particular, it doesn't support SVG fonts, animation, Javascript, css, or effects. Also, some attributes remain unimplemented or partially implemented, for example the *width* attribute of an *svg* entity cannot be expressed as a percentage. I hope users of this library will contribute back implementations of at least some of these. 

There are undoubtably bugs but I've used this library in all 8 apps I have in the App Store without issue so it is reasonably stable. Also, I would not label this a high performance renderer although I've never had cause to complain about it in the way I use it. 

The included library assumes ARC style memory management. It's also been set to support iOS 9 and up. I've moved to using code annotations such as *nullable* so it requires a recent version of Xcode to compile. Supports both traditional and module based framework includes.

Originally, this was distributed as a static library, but that is not a modern way to use it. So the enclosed project will build a framework, and most developers will probably find the use of **CocoaPods** more enjoyable. Requires CocoaPods 0.39 or above.

I've enabled **IB_DESIGNABLE** for the view classes for environments with a minimum OS version of iOS 8 and above. This will allow artwork and widgets to be visible in Interface Builder. CocoaPods users should put ````use_frameworks!```` in their Podfile.

The segmented control is not ready for use in tvOS apps. 

### As a Black Box Library
If you just want to use the code in your app and are uninterested in the underlying engine, the included Xcode project generates a framework (**SVGgh**) with the following public headers. By the way, the reason that classes tend to have a GH (Generally Helpful, or Glenn Howes) prefix is not narcissism, but an attempt of getting around the lack of a namespace in plain Objective-C.
* SVGDocumentView.h *A simple UIView capable of displaying a SVG document*
* GHButton.h *A flexible UIControl capable of having an embedded SVG document as an icon*
* GHSegmentedControl.h *A preliminary control which mimics a UISegmentedControl (incomplete)
* SVGParser.h *A class to load .svg files*
* SVGRenderer.h *A class to render SVG documents into a CGContextRef*
* GHControlFactory.h *A singleton class devoted to be a central location for widget theme look*
* GHImageCache.h *A singleton class devoted to caching and loading bitmap images*
* SVGToPDFConverter.h A class to convert the renderer's contents to a PDF.
* SVGPrinter.h A class to send a renderer's contents to a printer.

#### If you are familiar with using CocoaPods and using it in your project
* Insert ````pod 'SVGgh'```` into your PodFile
• If you set your deployment target to iOS 8 or above, you should insert 
````use_frameworks!```` in your Podfile. 

* Go through the standard procedures for updating your Xcode workspace via CocoaPods. ````pod update````, ````pod install````, etc.

#### If you are familiar with using Carthage and usin it in your project
* Insert **GenerallyHelpfulSoftware/SVGgh** to your Cartfile
* Execute `carthage update` command
* Drag the framework into your own Xcode project

For more information follow https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

#### If you are not using CocoaPods
To compile the framework. 
* Load the included **SVGgh.xcodeproj** project in Xcode 6.3 or above 
* **Build** the **Framework** target.
* Locate the **SVGgh.framework** framework
* Drag the framework into your own Xcode project

To use, you'll want to follow the following steps:
* Add the **SVGgh** library to your Xcode project.
* ````#include <SVGgh/SVGgh.h>;````

#### Once you have installed the library
* early in the launch of your app call 
    **[GHControlFactory setDefaultScheme:kColorSchemeClear];**
* early in the launch of your app call
**MakeSureSVGghLinks();** in order to link classes only referenced in storyboards or nibs. As in:

````
# import <SVGgh/SVGgh.h>

@implementation YourAppDelegate

+(void) initialize
{
    [super initialize];
    MakeSureSVGghLinks(); // classes only used in Storyboards might not link otherwise
    [GHControlFactory setDefaultScheme:kColorSchemeClear];
    [GHControlFactory setDefaultTextColor:[UIColor greenColor]];
}
...
````

* If you are coding in Swift and not using the ````use_frameworks!```` option in your Podfile, you will want to add ````#import <SVGgh/SVGgh.h>```` to your bridging header. If you are using ````use_frameworks!````, you will want to use ````import SVGgh```` in files that refer to SVGgh classes.  In your App delegate you should probably put the initialize code somewhere early, like:

````
	import SVGgh
	
    override class func initialize()
    {
        super.initialize()        
        MakeSureSVGghLinks()
        let tintColor = UIColorFromSVGColorString("#5D6")!
        GHControlFactory.setDefaultButtonTint(tintColor)
    }
````

To add a button to a .xib file or storyboard:
* Drag a UIView into your view
* In the **Identity Inspector** give it a **Custom Class** name of **GHButton**
* In Xcode you should see the following custom attributes in the Attribute Inspector pane

| Key Path | Type | Value |
| -------- | ---- | ----- |
| Artwork Path | String | Artwork/MenuButton (assumes you have such an asset) |
| Scheme Number | Number | 3 |


* Note that the **.svg** extension is assumed
* or if you are making a text button:

| Key Path | Type | Value |
| -------- | ---- | ----- |
| Title | Localized String | My Label |
| Scheme Number | Number | 3 |

* Here is a listing of available color schemes, some of which are more useful than others. I prefer 3, kColorSchemeClear.

| Constant |     Enumeration     | Description                                 |
| :------: | :----------------- | --------------------------------------------|
|    0     |    kColorSchemeiOS  | Round solid buttons with a thin inset ring  |
|    1     | kColorSchemeMachine | Grey top to bottom gradient with inset ring |
|    2     | kColorSchemeKeyboard| Gray gradient, light on top, no ring        |
|    3     | kColorSchemeClear   | Gray gradient, light on top, ring           |
|    4     | kColorSchemeEmpty   | No chrome. Just the artwork or label        |
|    5     | kColorSchemeHomeTheatre | Garish gold gradient, ring              |
|    6     | kColorSchemeiOSVersionAppropriate | kColorSchemeEmpty on iOS, kColorSchemeTVOS on AppleTV|
|    7     | kColorSchemeFlatAndBoxy | Solid fill color with square corners.   |
|    8     | kColorSchemeTVOS | Attempt to mimic the appearance and behavior of an AppleTV button.   |

* There is an attribute of an SVG document called ````currentColor````. You can access it to change the appearance of a button while being pressed via the **textColor**, **textColorPressed** and **textColorSelected** properties of **UIControl**. These are accessible from storyboard or you can set it up globally in your initialize method. Your SVGs will have to be written to use currentColor instead of some explicit color.

To add a static view to a .xib file or storyboard:
* Drag a UIView into your view
* In the **Identity Inspector** give it a **Custom Class** name of **SVGDocumentView**
* Using Xcode 6 and above you should see the following custom attribute in the Attribute Inspector pane

| Key Path | Type | Value |
| -------- | ---- | ----- |
| Artwork Path | String | Artwork/MyBackground |

* Note that the **.svg** extension is assumed. You may specify a custom file extension, if needed. For example, if you are using **.svgz** files you will need to include the file extension in the the **Artwork Path**.
* You should likely open the **Attributes Inspector** tab and set the **Mode** to **Aspect Fit** or possibly **Aspect Fill**.

* If you are only deploying on iOS 9 and above and want to use the data XCAsset type of resource, you can add the following to your app delegate's initialize method:
```
SVGghLoaderManager.setLoaderToType(SVGghLoaderTypeDataXCAsset)
```
* If you want to customize loading SVG documents, you can install a custom loader via
```
SVGghLoaderManager.setLoader(myCustomLoaderInstance)
```
	
#### Hints
* I like adding an Artwork folder to my target added as a 'Folder Reference' so that I can just drop things in from the Finder and they'll be added. Folder references show up in Xcode as blue folders.
* SVG has the ability to localize content as in the following fragment which localizes to Chinese:

```
<switch>
	<g systemLanguage ="zh">
		<text x="24" y="20" font-family="Helvetica" font-size="22"  fill="grey">绝对直线</text>
		<text x="218" y="95" font-family="Helvetica" font-style="italic" font-size="20" text-anchor="end" fill="blue">终点 x, y</text>
	</g>
	<g>
		<text x="24" y="20" font-family="Helvetica" font-size="22"  fill="grey">line to</text>
		<text x="218" y="95" font-family="Helvetica" font-style="italic" font-size="20" text-anchor="end" fill="blue">end x, y</text>
	</g>
</switch>
```	
* I've provided an Example.xcodeproj which displays an SVG in a view and displays a sharing button. 

### Under the Hood
If you are inclined to fix bugs or add features, and please do, then you'll be interested in the general mechanism by which an SVG document is converted to an onscreen image.     

The starting point is the **SVGRenderer**, which as a subclass of **SVGParser** is capable of loading in the XML of an SVG document and being used to render into a Core Graphics context (a CGContextRef).  The parser takes the XML and converts it to a tree composed of NSDictionaries and NSArrays of NSDictionaries. The NSDictionary at the root of this tree is used to create an **GHShapeGroup** which starts the process of building up a tree of **SVGAttributedObject**s, each of which knows how to render themselves. In general, when sending a message to an SVGAttributedObject, an object which implements the **SVGContext** protocol is provided so that certain state information is available to the SVGAttributedObject such as the currentColor or a method to look up the document tree for either a named object or an attribute defined by a parent. 

I've gone through and added Doxygen style comments to all the header files, so there is some hope of finding your way. 

### Attribution
While the vast majority of the code in this release was written by me. There are a couple of classes or categories that were found online but have a flexible enough license for me to include here. 
* [Ryan Hornberger] (http://www.ryanhornberger.com) was thoughtful enough to do something I had been too slammed to do: create a CocoaPod Spec for this library making it much more useful.
* I think a snippet from [Erica Sadun] (https://github.com/erica) was the basis of my UIColorFromSVGColorString, although it's grown quite a bit since then.
